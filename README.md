Hello there! I'm glad you're here.

I’m a dedicated and passionate Front-End Developer with over 7 years of experience, having transitioned into the tech industry in 2017 after a previous career. My journey in web development has been driven by a strong enthusiasm for creating responsive, dynamic, and visually captivating web applications.

I have extensive expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery, and have developed a variety of web solutions. I am proficient in PHP and experienced with modern frameworks, including Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Angular, Bootstrap, Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Ionic. I’ve also worked on numerous projects with popular CMS platforms like WordPress and Magento, tailoring them to meet diverse client needs.

On the design side, I bring ideas to life using tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, and Photoshop, ensuring that both functionality and aesthetics come together seamlessly. I employ Sass/Less for efficient styling and use Git for version control, enabling smooth collaboration across projects.

With a focus on continuous learning, I stay up to date with the latest trends in web development, pushing myself to adopt best practices and modern technologies to deliver scalable, high-quality solutions.
